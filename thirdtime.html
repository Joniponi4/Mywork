        I can write no stately proem<br>
        As a prelude to my lay;<br>
        From a poet to a poem<br>
        I would dare to say. </p>
    <p>
        For if of these fallen petals<br>
        One to you seem fair,<br>
        Love will waft it till it settles<br>
        On your hair.    </p>
    <p>
        And when wind and winter harden<br>
        All the loveless land,<br>
        It will whisper of the garden,<br>
        You will understand.

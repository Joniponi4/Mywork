					I can write no stately proem<br>
					As a prelude to my lay;<br>
					From a poet to a poem<br>
					I would dare to say.
				</p>
				<p>
					For if of these fallen petals<br>
					One to you seem fair,<br>
					Love will waft it till it settles<br>
					On your hair.
				</p>
				<p>
					And when wind and winter harden<br>
					All the loveless land,<br>
					It will whisper of the garden,<br>
					You will understand.
